                Hi there, I'm Sierra!

            <p>
                A newly graduated Melbourne based Software Engineer who is
                passionate about writing purposeful and clean code. I'm on the
                lookout for a new opportunity to put my creative problem solving
                skills to use.

                When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the
                outdoors â€” whether it's hiking in the Dandenong Ranges with my
                cocker spaniel, planning next season's kitchen garden, or
                sneakily stealing some feijoas from my neighbour's tree.
