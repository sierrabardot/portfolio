                Hi there, I'm Sierra! A newly graduated Melbourne based Software
                Engineer who is passionate about writing purposeful and clean
                code. I'm on the lookout for a new opportunity to put my
                creative problem solving skills to use.
            </p>

                When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me exploring the
                outdoors â€” whether it's hiking in the Dandenong Ranges with my
                cocker spaniel, planning next season's kitchen garden, or
                sneakily stealing some feijoas from my neighbour's tree.
